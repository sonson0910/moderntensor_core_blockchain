    """
    Integration test to send 50 "MichielCOIN" (MIT) tokens using send_token(...) 
    from a hotkey-based address to a receiver address.

    Prerequisites:
      - "MichielCOIN" token is already minted under a known policy_id.
      - The environment variables define TEST_RECEIVER_ADDRESS and TEST_POLICY_ID_HEX.
      - The hotkey fixture address must have enough ADA + token balances for the transfer.

    Steps:
      1) Read the receiver address from environment. If not present, skip.
      2) Read the policy_id_hex from environment. If not present, skip.
      3) Gather base_dir, coldkey_name, hotkey_name, password from environment or defaults.
      4) Call send_token(...), specifying the token details and chain context.
      5) Verify the returned tx_id is non-empty, indicating a successful transaction.

    Notes:
      - The function requires the hotkey address to hold at least 50 "MichielCOIN" 
        plus enough ADA for fees (set to 200k lovelace here).
      - If there's insufficient token/ADA, the test may fail or raise an exception.
